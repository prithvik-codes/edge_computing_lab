Title: IoT-Based Temperature and Humidity Monitoring using
Raspberry Pi 5 and Blynk Cloud

Objective
To interface a DHT11 sensor with a Raspberry Pi 5 and transmit real-time
environmental data to the Blynk IoT Cloud for remote visualization on a web and mobile
dashboard.
Background
In advanced IoT ecosystems, data processed at the edge (Raspberry Pi) is often pushed
to the cloud for long-term storage and remote monitoring.
• Blynk IoT: A platform that allows developers to create custom dashboards using
"Virtual Pins" to represent physical sensor data.
• RP1 Architecture: The Pi 5's dedicated I/O controller requires libgpiod to
manage sensor timing, which is critical for the DHT11's proprietary one-wire
protocol.

Materials Required
• Raspberry Pi 5 (with Internet Connection)
• DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
• Jumper Wires (Female-to-Female)
• 4.7kΩ - 10kΩ Resistor (if using a raw sensor)
• Blynk IoT Account (Cloud Console)

Circuit Diagram & Wiring
CRITICAL: Ensure the sensor is powered via the 3.3V pin. The Raspberry Pi 5 GPIO pins
are not 5V tolerant; using the 5V rail for data signaling will cause permanent damage to
the RP1 chip.

VCC (+) Power 3.3V Pin 1
GND (-) Ground Ground Pin 6
DATA (Out) Signal GPIO 4 Pin 7
